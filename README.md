Hello Everyone 👋🏼

My name is Bharat Dara and I'm passionate about learning new technologies, specially in the field of Data Science. I'm proficient with supervised and unsupervised Machine learning and currently learning about Deep Learning. I'm very intrigued by Computer Vision(CV) in particular and would love to implement the applications of CV in day-to-day life. I'm starting this new Github account for just creating new Data Science projects that I will be working on here after.
